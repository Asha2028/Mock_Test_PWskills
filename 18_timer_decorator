18. Implement a decorator function called ‘timer’ that measures the execution time of a function. 
The ‘timer’ decorator should print the time taken by the decorated function to execute. 
Use the ‘time’ module in Python to calculate the execution time.

Solution:

import time

def my_func(a, b):
    start_time = time.time();
    res = a+b
    print("the function ends in ", time.time()-start_time, "secs")
    return res

my_func(3,4)
