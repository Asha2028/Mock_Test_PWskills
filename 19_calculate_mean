19. Write a function called ‘calculate_mean’ that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the mean (average) of the numbers. 
The function should calculate the mean using the sum of the numbers divided by the total count.

Solution:

def calc_mean(data):
    count = len(data)
    sum, average =0,0
    for i in data:
        sum += i
        average = (sum//count)
    return average

import statistics

data = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(calc_mean(data))
# print(statistics.mean(data))
